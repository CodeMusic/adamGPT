<h3>Plot Outline üìñ:</h3>
<div class="plot">
    <h4 class="highlight">Introduction:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zeddy</b> and <b>Chrissy</b> arrive at Blues Fest as volunteers. The atmosphere is vibrant but tense due to their unresolved issues.</li>
        <li><b>Chrissy</b> is working on an AI project and plans to present it at a tech panel during the festival.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="conflict">Conflict:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zeddy</b> sends Chrissy a massive text file with her conversations with Adam, intending for Chrissy to let his AI process it to understand how to communicate better with her.</li>
        <li>Chrissy finds this overwhelming and realizes the extent of her emotional entanglement with Adam.</li>
        <li>Chrissy discovers that Zeddy has been seeing Adam secretly. This revelation devastates him, but he tries to work through it because he values their relationship.</li>
        <li>Chrissy notices that Zeddy's harsh words towards him often mirror Adam's, realizing how much control Adam has over Zeddy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="emotional">Climax:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>At Blues Fest, Chrissy presents his AI project, but the tension with Zeddy overshadows his achievements. The stress peaks when Adam shows up at the festival.</li>
        <li>Chrissy confronts Zeddy about her behavior and the emotional abuse. He realizes that Adam's manipulation has deeply affected Zeddy, turning her into a version of the Queen of Hearts from "Alice in Wonderland," controlling and belittling Chrissy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="resolution">Resolution:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alice</b> approaches <b>Adam</b> and <b>Zeddy</b> and says, "Don't you remember before this pattern isn't new and emerged was Zeddy's ex, XX?" This highlights the recurring pattern in Zeddy's relationships and the need for her to break free from manipulative influences.</li>
        <li>After this realization, <b>Chrissy</b> approaches <b>Zeddy</b>, <b>Adam</b> and <b>XX</b>. He calmly but firmly addresses the situation:</li>
        <li>Chrissy explains that he sees the destructive pattern and understands how Zeddy has been influenced by both Adam and XX.</li>
        <li>He tells Zeddy that he cares for her deeply but cannot continue in a relationship where she doesn't respect herself or him.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="conclusion">Aftermath and Conclusion:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Zeddy, feeling a mix of shame and realization, begins to understand the depth of her actions and the influence of her past relationships. She realizes she needs to break free from these toxic patterns for her own sake.</li>
        <li>Chrissy decides to focus on his own self-worth and projects. He stops trying to fix the relationship unilaterally, realizing that Zeddy needs to deal with her issues with Adam and XX independently.</li>
        <li>Zeddy starts therapy or seeks support to address her emotional entanglements and build her self-esteem. She acknowledges Chrissy's efforts and expresses a desire to work on herself.</li>
        <li>Adam and XX, confronted with their behaviors, leave the festival, leaving Zeddy with a chance to reflect on her choices without their influence.</li>
        <li>Chrissy finds a sense of self-worth and moves forward, focusing on his AI projects and personal growth. He remains open to the possibility of reconciliation with Zeddy, but only if she genuinely changes.</li>
        <li>Zeddy begins a journey of self-discovery and healing, understanding that true happiness comes from within and not from seeking validation from toxic relationships.</li>
